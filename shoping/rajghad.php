                        <p class="py-5">rajghad Fort is another good trekking spot situated in the Igatpuri region. The
                            fort appears rectangular from the base and the resting rock of the fort is triangular in
                            shape. The walls of the trekking way are vertical and steps have been carved into the rock.
                            It is preferable to explore the trek during the monsoon season, but you should have a
                            professional guide with you. There is a temple at the top and you will get to have an
                            amazing view of the environment and surroundings when you are trekking to the top.

                                    <h3>1. Padmavat Temple</h3>
                                    A temple located inside the fortress is dedicated to the goddess Padmavati, this is
                                    one of the are major attractions. Goddess Padmavati is another form of Goddess Maha
                                    Lakshmi and is also called Alamelu. It is also used by the trekkers for overnight
                                    stay. This temple was constructed by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj himself.<br />
                                    <h3>2. Rameshwar Temple</h3>
                                    You can enjoy the beauty of the Rameshwar temple which is located within the fort.
                                    This temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva, also called Lord Rameshwar.
                                    There is a unique&nbsp;replica&nbsp;of Shiva Linga that dates back to the times of
                                    Shivaji, around the 1600s. This is a smaller temple that lies in the front yard of
                                    Padmavat temple. <br />
                                    <h3>3. Saibai's Tomb</h3>
                                    Among Shivaji's eight wives, Sai Bhosale was his chief companion and his first wife
                                    too. It is believed that he loved Saibai a lot. But the beloved couple wasn't meant
                                    to be together for long. Saibai breathed her last at the Rajgad fort and a tomb was
                                    constructed in her memory.<br />
                                    <h3>4. Padmavati Lake</h3>
                                    It is a small freshwater lake. Its walls are intact even today and this lake never
                                    dries up. The Chor darwaja or the secret doorway leads to the Padmavati lake
                                    directly. You can pretty easily spot small fishes in the Padmavati lake.<br />
                                    <h3>5. Alu, Pali and Gunjavane Darwazas</h3>
                                    The fort is adorned by several doors including the Gunjavane darwaja, Alu darwaja
                                    and Pali darwaja. These darwazas are nothing but entrances to the Rajgad fort. And
                                    these elaborate doorways also served as guards to the fortress. The Alu darwaja was
                                    used in the olden times to connect the Rajgad fort to the Torna fort, but it now
                                    lies in ruins. There are several citadels as well. While the Pali darwaja, which is
                                    the main door of Rajgad fort, is still intact. There is also a secret back door that
                                    leads to the fort called the 'Chor Darwaja'. A steep, narrow and curved staircase
                                    that leads to it. This was built as a secret escape at times of crisis. Similar to
                                    the Chor darwaja, there's another secret doorway called the 'Madhe Darwaja' that
                                    extends from the Suvela Machi.<br /><br />

                                    Rajgad Fort is also famous for the Sanjivani machi, Suvela machi and Padmavati
                                    machi. The Padmavati machi was used as the main structure to protect the fort,
                                    during the reign of Marathas.

                                    Swarajya' (Hindu Kingdom) and is believed to be the king of forts in India. Its
                                    history&nbsp;dates back to 1646-1647. The fort of Rajgad stood witness to several
                                    important battles of the Marathas. It was captured by the Mughals in 1689 after
                                    Shivaji's son Sambhaji died. It is believed that Shivaji spent most of his life at
                                    the Rajgad fort. </div>

                                    the two temples or even camp in the fort. Stay overnight at this magnificent fort
                                    and enjoy camping in the fort by putting up your tents and lighting a bonfire, if
                                    you are visiting it in winters. There is plenty of room in the Padmavat Temple and
                                    it can easily accommodate 50-60 people. There is also a smaller temple within the
                                    premises of the fort that can accommodate around 8-10 people. If you have a tent
                                    then you can simply pitch your tent in the large area available. There is no entry
                                    fee and the fort remains open to visitors the entire week. It is preferable to carry
                                    some snacks and water is you are planning to put up at the fort for a night. </div>

                                    fort. Also, the villagers serve Zunka Bhakri, Tea, Poha and Bhaji at the Padmavat
                                    temple, on weekends. If you are a non-vegetarian, you can enjoy the chicken-bhakri
                                    at the local restaurants nearby. You can relish the lip-smacking Maharashtrian
                                    cuisine here. If you are planning to put up at the fort, for a night- getting your
                                    dinner packed on the way is the best option. </div>
